Summary:
	The kernel reports an Oops in the tulip driver while hibernating, but not every time. (It occurs perhaps 30% to 50% of the time.) The system hangs, caps lock and scroll lock flash, and the computer has to be powered off by holding down the power button. There  may be a race condition between the suspend and delivery of a pending IRQ. Ie the suspend path isn't waiting until either the interrupt has been delivered or possibly delivered but not completed handling of the interrupt.
