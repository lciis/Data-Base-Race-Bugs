Summary:
	When the LID is closed and then opened, the display sometimes stops working and kacpi_notify uses 100% CPU forever. The reboot seems to be needed to fix the problem. It seems like a race condition between the intel_lid_notify in intel_lvds.c and something the BIOS (or any other component)
