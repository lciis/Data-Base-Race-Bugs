Component: Sound(ALSA)

Kernel Version: Tiwai for-next
Tree: Mainline

Summary:
	Using Tiwai's for-next branch (at ALSA: hda_intel: add AZX_DCAPS_I915_POWERWELL for SKL and BSW) makes anything instantly perma-freeze that tries to use the Creative Core3D (CA0132) chip on my Gigabyte G1.Sniper M5. This also causes systemd to wait infinitely to store the sound card state on shutdown. There is a race between the runtime PM suspend and the concurrent access via alsactl during suspend.
