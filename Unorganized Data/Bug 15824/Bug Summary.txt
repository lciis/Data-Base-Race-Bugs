Summary:
	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)

Bug Description:
	The issue seems to be related to scan races within the code. It is possible for internal scan to race against itself if the device is not returning the scan results from first requests. What happens in this case is the cleanup done during the abort of the first internal scan also cleans up part of the new scan, causing it to access memory it shouldn't.
