Summary:
	There is a lock must be held before entering update_stats.

Problem Description:
	A lock must be held before calling function update_stats().This rule is followed in some cases, but not in some others. The lock is held when the function is called in function el3_get_stats().  But the queue lock is NOT held when the function is called in el3_close(). It can cause potential data races. These functions are all in "drivers/net/pcmcia/3c589_cs.c.
