Summary:
	there is a potential race condition between the host and the hardware in reading
the next link in the transmit descriptor list:

	cpu0              	hw
                 		tx for buf completed
                		raise tx_ok interrupt
	process buf
	buf->ds_link = 0
           	       		read buf->ds_link
