Authors of SymDrive test drivers with the following procedure:
		1. Run SymGen over the driver and compile the output.
		2. Define a virtual hardware device with the desired parameters and boot the SymDrive virtual machine.
		3. Load the driver with insmod and wait for initialization to complete successfully. Completing this step entails executing at least one successful path and returning success, though it is likely that other failed paths also run and are subsequently discarded.
		4. Execute a workload (optional). We ensure all network drivers attempt to transmit and that sound drivers attempt to play a sound.
		5. Unload the driver (rmmod)
		
In order to complete the steps 2 and 4, understanding of the targeted driver is required to set up the configuration of the virtue hardware(step 1) and write the workload (test 4: test program).

If a simple driver is put into the testing phase, the same setting (Step 2) of SymDrive provided example lp5523 can be used.

Step 3 is done with insmod, and it invoked the driver's start function. 

Step 5 is done with rmmod and it invoked the driver's exit function.

Symdrive does not automatically invoke every function in the driver. A test program is usually required to do this task.
	Example:	driver A
				functions:
					Start();
					Exit();
					Read();
					Write();	
					Open();
					Close();
			insmod A will invoke start()
			rmmod A will invoke exit()
			Modifying the dev file that associates with this driver triggers other functions
				In user mode, Opening this dev file will invoke open();
					Reading this dev file will invoke read();
					Writing this dev file will invoke write();
					Closing this dev file will invoke close();

*The test program of lp5523 is provided as the example in SymDrive.
