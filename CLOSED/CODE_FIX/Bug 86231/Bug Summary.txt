Component: network-wireless
Hardware: All Linux
Reported: 2014-10-14 10:11 UTC

Kernel Version: 3.17-rc7
Tree: Mainline
Status: CLOSED CODE_FIX

Summary:
	If the RFkill interrupt fires while we calibrate, it would
	make the firmware fail and the driver wasn't able to recover.
	Change the flow so that the driver will kill the firmware
	in that case.

	Since we have now two flows that are calling
	trans_stop_device (the RFkill interrupt and the
	op_mode_mvm_start function) - we need to better sync this.
	Use the STATUS_DEVICE_ENABLED in the pcie transport in an
	atomic way to achieve this.

	Every once in a while, the wireless driver (iwlwifi) prints "Microcode SW error detected" during boot (I will attached a full dmesg). In this case, the wireless card is not detected properly, not shown by "ip addr" nor by NetworkManager. I never saw this appear with kernels up to 3.14, I see it fairly often with the 3.16 Debian kernel, and it still happens occasionally with 3.17-rc7 vanilla. Sometimes, it seems to be "stuck" in that state, so even booting into an older kernel, the error will still appear. No amount of cold-rebooting or even pulling out the battery will fix this.

	In any case, I can run the command

	  sudo modprobe -r iwlmvm && sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi && sudo modprobe iwlwifi

	to make it load properly. This also seems to "reset" the "stuck" state. In other words, now doing a reboot to a 3.14 or older reliably brings the card up on boot. So the only time I saw this failure with <=3.14 on boot was if the same failure was already shown on the previous boot, and I did *not* re-load the module to fix that. With 3.16+, the bug can happen even if the previous boot was fine. That's why I consider this a regression.

	I reported this bug against Debian as well, and another user seems to have the same issue: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763172>

	Here's what lspci has to say about the card:

	03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260 (rev 73)
			Subsystem: Intel Corporation Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260
			Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 34
			Memory at ddc00000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]
			Capabilities: [c8] Power Management version 3
			Capabilities: [d0] MSI: Enable+ Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit+
			Capabilities: [40] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
			Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting
			Capabilities: [140] Device Serial Number fc-f8-ae-ff-ff-51-88-9e
			Capabilities: [14c] Latency Tolerance Reporting
			Capabilities: [154] Vendor Specific Information: ID=cafe Rev=1 Len=014 <?>
			Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi

	The Debian package firmware-iwlwifi is at version 0.43 (whatever that means). Curiously, the dmesg says

	[   12.055632] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Direct firmware load for iwlwifi-7260-10.ucode failed with error -2
	[   12.058021] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: loaded firmware version 23.214.9.0 op_mode iwlmvm

	I assume this means that it didn't find the -10 ucode (which, according to <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi>, is still experimental), and then falls back to the -9? The following ucodes for the 7260 exist on my disk:

	$ ls /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-7260-* -l
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 683236 Jun 16 01:51 /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-7260-7.ucode
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 679780 Jun 16 01:51 /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-7260-8.ucode
	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 679380 Jun 16 01:51 /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-7260-9.ucode
