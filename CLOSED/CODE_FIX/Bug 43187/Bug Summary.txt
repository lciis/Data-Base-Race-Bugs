Kernel Version: 3.3.1-3.3.4
Tree: Mainline
Status: CLOSED CODE_FIX

Summary:
	In commit b0302ab, the rtlwifi family of drivers was converted to use
asynchronous firmware loading. Unfortumately, the implementation was
racy, and the ieee80211 routines could be started before rtl_init_core()
was called to setup the data.

	After updating to the 3.3.1 kernel, my wifi card cannot be used anymore because the firmware loading fails, see dmesg:

	[    6.599066] rtlwifi:rtl_fw_cb():<0-0> Can't register mac80211 hw

	I'm using firmware from the rtl_92ce_92se_92de_linux_mac80211_0005.1230.2011 package provided by realtek. The same file works fine in 3.3.0, so I guess this is related to the switch to asyncronous firmware loading in 3.3.1. (see http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/ChangeLog-3.3.1 )

	I'm using the gentoo and bfs patches.

	Trial patch for incorrect initialization - #2

	Please try this one. The current thinking is that there is a racy condition that shows up when the driver is loaded with the firmware cached that causes the initialization to be done in the wrong order.

	This one does not fail on bootup. I have no idea if it fixes the other problem as I still have not duplicated it.
