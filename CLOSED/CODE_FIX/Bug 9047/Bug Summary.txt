Kernel Version: 2.6.26
Tree: Mainline
Status: CLOSED CODE_FIX

Summary:
	This bug has been identified as the issue with the forcedeth driver has a too-low value for max_interrupt_work. 
The fix is simply to increase the max_interrupt_work number. Although the fix has nothing to do with race, many comments 
have suspected race as a part of the problem. Unfortunately, none of these suspicions is verified.

	Most recent kernel where this bug did not occur: unknown
	Distribution: Gentoo 2007.0
	Hardware Environment: amd64/x86_64 - 2 x Opeteron 2220s on Tyan S2927 motherboard
	Software Environment: Gentoo Linux, mostly 64-bit userland w/ multilib
	Problem Description:The kernel will either Oops from a NULL ptr dereference in forcedeth.c or the network interface will stop but the system will still respond on the serial while logging message about irq abuse into the dmesg.

	Steps to reproduce:  We have an in house application which makes heavy use of NFS.  Allowing this program to run for a few minutes will consistently reproduce the issue.  It is almost always an Oops on a single CPU with perhaps a 1 out of 5 chance of seeing the dead network but system still up failure mode.  This issue also occurs with 2.6.22 "gentoo-r3" but the "NULL" value being deferenced is 0x64 instead of 0x7c.  Perhaps the strangest of all, having sysctl parameters set which affect tcp window scaling prevent a full stack trace in the oops message.

	There was a MSI fix recently. As for NAPI, I believe there is a race condition for turning on/off interrupts between the 3 threads: 
nv_nic_irq_optimized, nv_do_nic_poll and nv_do_napi_poll. I am in the midst of fixing that race.
