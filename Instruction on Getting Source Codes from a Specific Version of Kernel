The easiest and most bandwidth-friendly way, if you expect to do this more than once, would be to clone the kernel's git repository and check out the version you want based on its tag. It's probably best to clone the linux-stable repo, since that will include tags for all of the stable releases:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
cd linux
git checkout v2.6.36.2
To later switch to another version, it's easy:

git checkout v3.5.2
To update your repository to include all of the latest tags and commits:

git fetch
