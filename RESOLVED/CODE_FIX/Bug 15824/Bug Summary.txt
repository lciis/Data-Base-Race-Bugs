Hardware: All Linux

Kernel Version: 2.6.34-rc5
Tree: Mainline
Status:	RESOLVED CODE_FIX

Summary:
	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null). The issue seems to be related to scan races within the code. It is possible for internal scan to race against itself if the device is not returning the scan results from first requests. What happens in this case is the cleanup done during the abort of the first internal scan also cleans up part of the new scan, causing it to access memory it shouldn't.

	This happened while connected to an 802.11N network (the PC froze completely) and looks to me like it's a problem in iwl. I've included the kernel log which shows the oops at the end: there are several warnings preceding it.

	Johannes's "fix scan races" is definitely related to this problem. This problem looks very similar to https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15667, which is fixed by that patch.

Proposed Fix:
	Notes:
		It is possible for internal scan to race against itself if the device is
		not returning the scan results from first requests. What happens in this
		case is the cleanup done during the abort of the first internal scan also
		cleans up part of the new scan, causing it to access memory it shouldn't.
		-The fix is twofold.
		* Since "is_internal_short_scan" should be protected by mutex, fix this in scan completion work so that changes to it can be serialized.
		* Do not queue a new internal scan if one is in progress.
