Kernel Version: 3.6.6
Tree: Mainline
Status: RESOLVED CODE_FIX

Summary:
	Reproducible hard lockup when recording from USB mic and playing through snd_hda_intel. The cause is unclear, but it causes a lockup behavior. Thus, It may be a race.

	[copying to Greg as this might turn out to be a USB bug, not an ALSA bug]

	System: Debian unstable (x86-64 kernel and userland), mainline 3.6.6 kernel

	Marking as regression as I've never seen this on 3.4.x and downwards that I previously used. There has been some erratic behavior before -- that I have ascribed to the crappiness of Audacity, the recording software -- but hard lockups never. So whatever race (I guess) causes this might be old, but the lockup behavior is new.

	Hardware: Blue Snowball USB Microphone; Asus P8P67 EVO motherboard with Intel hda audio.

	What I do:

	1. Start audacity (the audio piece of software)
	2. Edit->Preferences, configure recording device as Blue Snowball, one channel, and playback device as HDA Intel PCH: ALC892 Analog. In Recording section, enable "Software Playthrough: Listen while recording or monitoring new track".
	3. Start recording.

	One of several things happen at random:

	3a. The recording starts and works nicely. The recorded audio is played through the HDA soundcard.

	3b. The recording seems to start, but jams immediately. The system remains responsive and the recording can be stopped. Evidently audacity just doesn't get any samples from the USB mic.

	3c. The recording seems to start, but the samples received are bogus. The bogus samples are played through the HDA soundcard, making quite a noise.

	3d. The entire system freezes immediately. The USB keyboard stops working. The system does not respond to pings via the motherboard's network card.

	I have now repeated this test three times, and each time it was easy to reproduce the hard lockup. The last time I had a netconsole running, and I have a backtrace for you (below). If you want me to do any further debugging or testing, I'll be happy to be of help.

	Yup, it seems I cannot reproduce the lockup under 3.7-rc5.

	After some torturing like starting and stopping recording with playthrough 50ish times, I did get this in my dmesg though (at the same time, audacity hung, but after killing and restarting it it works again):

Proposed Fix:
	The bug seemed to be unreproducible in the current kernel.
